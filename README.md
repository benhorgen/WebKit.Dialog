WebKit.Dialog
=============

NOTE: This project is an attempt to port the ideas and ease of use of the 
MonoTouch.Dialog project to WebKit (HTML5).  Given the significant differences 
in the layout and UI architectures between iOS and WebKit, some things will 
inevitably be different between the projects but conceptually WebKit.Dialog
should stay very close to MonoTouch.Dialog.
